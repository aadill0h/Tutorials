# What is SSH

SSH, or Secure Shell, gives users a secure way to access a computer over a network. This enables us to authenticate the identity of a user trying to access a device over the internet. SSH uses public and private keys to authenticate users.

# What is a Public Key

A public key is something that can be shared with anyone and helps authenticate your identity when you try to access a remote device.

# What is Your Private Key

Your private key is used to decrypt messages that are encrypted using your public key and helps verify commits and other things you do on the internet. It's a sort of signature proving it is you.

<^>**DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY WITH ANYONE**<^>
